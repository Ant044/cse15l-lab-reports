# **Lab 5 Lab report**
## **Part 1 - Debugging**

**Student:** Hello! I'm having an issue with using JUnit with my bash script. When I run this grading script, it tells me that the package org.junit
does not exist. I've double checked the file names and made sure that it has the right version of junit and that it's in the right place, but it doesn't work. I remember this script working when I used it on ieng6 but it doesn't seem to work on my Windows computer, so I think it might be an operating system issue.
```sh
CPATH='.:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar'

rm -rf student-submission
rm -rf grading-area

mkdir grading-area

git clone $1 student-submission
echo 'Finished cloning'

#Check if the submission is a java file
if [[ -e student-submission/ListExamples.java ]]
then
    echo "File found. Continuing"
else 
    echo "File not found. Terminating."
    exit
fi



cp student-submission/ListExamples.java grading-area/ListExamples.java
cp TestListExamples.java grading-area/TestListExamples.java

cp -R lib grading-area

cd grading-area
javac -cp $CPATH *.java

java -cp $CPATH org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples > results.txt

if [[ `grep "Tests run:" results.txt` ]]
then
echo "Test failed. F."
else
echo "Test passed. A."
fi
```

**TA:** Hey, you pointed out that you were using a windows operating system? If you look at your CPATH variable, notice that the string is using a colon. Colons work in Linux and Mac, however if you're trying to run it from Windows, is there a different character you could use in its place?

**Student:** I replaced the colon with the semicolon and it seems to work as intended now. Thanks! The bug was that I was using an operation that wasn't intended for windows while using windows.

The initial directory structure is generated by using `git clone https://github.com/Ant044/list-examples-grader.git`, and the rest of it is generated by running `bash grade.sh https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected`. To fix the bug, you replace the colons with semicolons in the first uncommented line of the `grade.sh` file.


## **Part 2 - Reflection**
Learning how to use vim was probably one of my favorite things in the second half of the quarter. It's very useful to be able to edit from the command line, and it wasn't stressful like trying and failing to debug stuff.
